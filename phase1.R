# Unsupervised learning classifier â€” K-Means clustering

# Remember that in addition to these gene lists, we expect
# the SnC population to be more abundant (~ 5-20X or more abundant)
# in the samples derived from old mice relative to the young mice,
# which should also be incorporated into your scoring criteria.
